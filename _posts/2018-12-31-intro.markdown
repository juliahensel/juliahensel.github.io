Hello to the cyberspace world. Our names are Julia and Emily. We are, respectively, a consultant and a computer scientist. We’ve been friends for years, and we have a lot of weird thoughts we finally decided to share with the world. That’s what this blog will be for: giving life to the strange thoughts that bounce around in our heads day-to-day. Some of these thoughts are significant; most of them aren’t. Regardless, we think we’re funny, and we know that the world can be downright mean. Sometimes, it’s nice to take life with a grain of salt and a laugh or two. We hope the Accidental Chia Pet can provide both for you.

Of course, you’re probably wondering how much we are being paid for the Chia Pet endorsement in our blog title. The answer is $0, and please don’t tell the Chia Pet company that we exist because we would rather avoid a lawsuit. Rather, the name comes from an incident in our college years.

We lived together our sophomore and junior years of college, and during our junior year housing services decided we were “mature” enough to live in an apartment with two other women. The basis for this mystifying judgement remains elusive. Honored and overwhelmed by the independence of living “on our own,” we entered junior year with gusto. We had good grades, friends who cared about us, and a sufficient number of faux chic dorm decorations from Target’s “Re:” collection.  We tried hard to keep a clean house, which mostly looked like us thinking about vacuuming and occasionally doing laundry when we ran out of underwear.

One major area oft-overlooked, however, was the kitchen sink. In our defense, does anyone really think about the kitchen sink? 

What we didn’t realize, though, is that this minor oversight would grow (no pun intended) into a larger issue when one of our dear roommates picked up a new diet that involved using chia seeds for their many health benefits.  

One day when Julia was struck with a cleaning fit, she decided to tackle the pile of dishes in the kitchen sink that was growing in a way that began to resemble the Tower of Pisa.  As she picked up the dish rag to begin cleaning, she realized that the pile of dishes wasn’t the only thing that was growing: a small chia plant had begun sprouting through the dish rag.  Apparently, a damp, dark dishrag had been the perfect environment to bring this new little plant to life. Horrified by this (although also secretly proud, as this is the only plant she had ever successfully grown), Julia rushed to tell her roommates the news.

As we laughed about the incident, we realized that the Accidental Chia Pet was truly emblematic of our lives both during and post-college. We work hard, we care deeply, but we sometimes think we have it a lot more together than we actually do. 

As this blog matures, you can expect musings that bring to life our competent and non-competent sides alike.  We’ll share our thoughts on anything from computer security to freezer cooking to train commuting to ordering and negotiating at restaurants.  We look forward to sharing with you.
